Answer 1:
Test 1 took around 2.5 hour to get completed and Test 2 took around 4 hours .Though I have little knowledge about front end coding, so test 2 is still not upto the mark. If I had more time I would like to add login authentication, session storage, caching through redis.
In test 2 if i had more time i would like to brush up my css and try to make that page more attractive and add beautiful micro interactions. 

Answer 2:
  If there is any performance issue in production then I would first go through logs of every worker like laravel worker, node worker or redis worker. Then i would add logs to specific function ,which i feel is taking time, to monitor. Then also if problem is not solved I would go through nginx or apache logs. If am able to solve the problem then I would add any service like cloudwatch which analyse the performance of a service or a function in realtime and we can set parameters in that if our function or service crosses the threshold than it will automatically send mail and sms to us.
